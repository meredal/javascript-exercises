# javascript exercises

This respository is meant to be some practice on simple and growing into more complex javascript exercises. I will be adding to it periodically when time allows. It isn't hosted anywhere, I am just running it locally with alerts and console.log statements to check and make sure the code I'm writing works the way it is intended. Feel free to check it out!
